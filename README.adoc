= Metanorma taste for the MBx Interoperability Forum (MBx-IF)

== Purpose

This document provides basic configuration information for MBx-IF authors using
Metanorma.

This repository is managed collectively by the MBx-IF and Ribose.

== About MBx-IF

The MBx Interoperability Forum (MBx-IF) is an international, vendor-neutral
operating framework dedicated to advancing the use of the STEP standard (ISO
10303) for product data exchange and interoperability across various domains.

MBx-IF is a collaborative effort between AFNeT, PDES, Inc., and prostep ivip.

The MBx-IF addresses Computer-Aided-"x" (Design, Manufacturing, Inspection) (CAx),
Product Data Management (PDM), Electrical Wiring Interconnection Systems (EWIS),
and Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE).


== Implementation details

The `mbxif` document class of Metanorma is implemented as a Metanorma Taste, which
is a set of customizations to Metanorma that implement the MBx-IF's specific
requirements for document formatting and styling.

The `mbxif` document class is defined in the `metanorma-taste` gem, which is
automatically installed when you install the `metanorma` gem.


== Types of documents

MBx-IF publishes a variety of documents. Each type of document is referred to as
a `doctype` in Metanorma.

The `mbxif` document class supports the following `doctype` values:

`recommended-practices`:: Recommended Practices. These are normative documents
that define recommended technical practices.

`general-guidelines`:: General Guidelines. These are informative documents that
provide general guidance on implementation approaches and best practices.

`test-suite`:: Test Suite. These are technical documents that specify testing
methodologies, test cases, and validation procedures.


== Authoring a MBx-IF document

A MBx-IF document in Metanorma is realized with a Metanorma AsciiDoc file with
the `.adoc` extension.

In this file, include the appropriate document header attributes and its
content.

The necessary document header attributes and document structures are described
in the following sections.


== Document structure

While there is no mandatory document structure of a MBx-IF document, the following sections are recommended:

NOTE: The "Introduction" section is required for all document types.

* (unnumbered) Overview (optional)
* (unnumbered) Introduction
* (Clause 1) Scope
* (Clause 2) Normative references
* (Clause 3) Terms and definitions
* (Clause 4...n) Body of the recommended practices
* (Annex A...n) Annexes (optional)
* (unnumbered) Bibliography (optional)

contributors to the document. In the PDF format, the contributors
are displayed on the back cover of the document.

Every contributor in an MBx-IF document is separated into categories that are
grouped and displayed. e.g. "LOTAR EAS", "CAx-IF", "Technical", etc. The
category is expressed using the `:role-description:` attribute.

Contributor information is specified in the document header using the following
attributes:

== Document clause contents

=== General

Metanorma is a semantic textual processor that imposes particular syntax on
structured elements.

In particular, the bibliographic sections ("Normative references", "References",
"Bibliography") and the "Terms and definitions" section support complex needs,
with further details provided in official Metanorma documentation.

=== Introduction

The Introduction section provides a brief summary of the document's content,
including its purpose, scope, and key points.

.Example of an Introduction section
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
== Introduction

Product and Manufacturing Information (PMI) is used in 3D Computer-aided Design
(CAD) systems to convey information about the product requirements for
manufacturing, inspection, and sustainment, which supplements the geometric shape
of the product. This includes but is not limited to dimensions, tolerances,
surface finish, weld symbols, material specifications, and user-defined attributes
defined as 3D annotations. A Unicode string representation of this information
allows a consistent definition when translating into STEP.

This report defines *rules* for Unicode strings of Geometric Dimensioning and
Tolerancing (GD&T), Surface Finish, and Weld symbols as defined in ASME and ISO
standards.
----
====

=== Scope

The Scope clause defines the subject matter and the extent of the document's
coverage.

.Example of a Scope clause
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
== Scope

*The following are within the scope of this document*:

* Rules that define how GD&T, Surface Finish, and Weld symbol information should
be represented as Unicode strings.
* 4 letter Unicode representation of GD&T, Surface Finish and Weld symbols.

*The following are out of the scope of this document*:

* An exhaustive list of GD&T, Surface Finish, and Weld symbol examples.
* Graphical and semantic representation of the GD&T.
----
====

=== Normative references

The Normative references clause lists the documents that are indispensable for
the application of the document.

.Example of the Normative references clause
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
[bibliography]
== Normative references

* [[[ASME_Y14-5-2018,ASME Y14.5-2018]]]
* [[[ASME_Y14-36-2018,ASME Y14.36-2018]]]
* [[[ISO_2553,ISO 2553:2019]]]
* [[[ISO_1101,ISO 1101:2017]]]
* [[[ISO_14405-3,ISO 14405-3:2016]]]
----
====


=== Terms and definitions

The Terms and definitions clause provides definitions of terms used in the
document. Each term is defined as a subclause.

For detailed usage, please refer to Metanorma documentation.

.Example of a Terms and definitions clause

== Terms and definitions

=== Concatenation

In the context of digital data, string concatenation is the operation of joining
more than one character string together. For example, concatenating the strings
"hello" and "world" would result in the string "helloworld."

In this document, each separate annotation entity that contains text or Unicode
characters is defined as a separate string. However, as many of these strings are
specified in a set and are related to one another, the strings may be concatenated
into a larger superstring. Each string that makes up the superstring is readily
identifiable as a separate string by its leading keyword, which will aid software
queries intending to extract or understand a particular string, and represents a
level of the semantic relationship between the constituent strings.

=== Grouping

Grouping is when a set of objects are combined to make a group of information.
Grouping can be used to keep information within a compartment together.
----
====


=== Annexes

An annex is a section that provides additional information related to the main
content of the document.

Annexes can be normative or informative, set using the `obligation` attribute of
the `[appendix]` element.

.Example of an annex
[example]
====

=== Bibliography

The Bibliography section lists documents that are relevant to the document but
not indispensable for its application.
